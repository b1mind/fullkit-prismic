Todo:
  ☐ come up with a better slice page structure (https://prismic.io/docs/content-relationship)
  ☐ Make a serializer for MD RichText but keep options for component (maybe slice variation?)
  ☐ Learn more about slices options. (Finish Alex's course video)

WishList:
  ☐ learn Prismic Graph query (https://prismic.io/docs/graphquery-rest-api)
  ☐ convert this to a template we can npx into a new Prismic repo/site

Debt:
  ☐ learn how to use jsDocs and properly fix @ type any
  ☐ fix $$restProps on components/slices (is there another way?)
